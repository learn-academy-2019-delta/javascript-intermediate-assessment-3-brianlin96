2. Why would you use object destructuring?

  Your answer: So you can be a bit lazier and not have to type out everything 

  Researched answer: Allows you to access nested objects within an array or another object with one word. Allows you to make your code look nicer



3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer: Testing is important because it allows one to check the code for completeness and full functionality

  Researched answer: Software testing is about testing a feature with varying test data to get a result and then
comparing the actual result with expected result. It is not merely finding defects or bugs in the software; it is
the completely dedicated discipline of evaluating the quality of the software


4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is the blueprint for an object. The object is the intersection between data and behavior 

  Researched answer: Classes and objects from the essential part of Object-oriented programming, where a class can be considered as a construct which encapsulates a group of variables and methods; whereas, an object acts as member or instance of that class.


5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

  Your answer: import tag with stylesheet and the source of where the CSS file is. All of this goes into the head 

  Researched answer: 
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="theme.css">   
  </head>


2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

  Your answer: Span is more of an inline container while div is used to seperate other html elements

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.


3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer: A CSS class is an attribute that can incorporate multiple HTML elements and change them together. IDs can only be given to individual elements; thus, you can only change one element at a time whereas for classes you can change multiple elements at the same time

  Researched answer: The HTML class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name. So, all HTML elements with the same class attribute will get the same style.The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.


4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

  Your answer: <p></p>, <h1></h1>, <ul></ul>, <blockquote></blockquote>

  Researched answer: <del></del>, <acronym></acronym>, <abbr></abbr>, <cite></cite>


5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: ??

  Researched answer: Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes.


### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

  Your answer: Front end development is handling the creation of the look of an application. The tools would be HTML, CSS, JS, React, Electron.

  Researched answer: Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.


2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

  Your answer: The scope in which you defined variables can exist in

  Researched answer: A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.


3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

  Your answer: Having another object retain the same defined constructor as its parent object

  Researched answer: Inheritance in most class-based object-oriented languages is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of another object.
